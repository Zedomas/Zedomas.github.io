# Rob's Blackjack with cheats enabled 

This is Blackjack made using deckofcardsapi.com.

DeckofcardsApi.com is an api that can generate a unique deck and manipulate it to do whatever you can do with cards.

## What does it do?

I used it to create a deck made up of six different decks of cards. I then kept track of cards drawn and their values.
I used supplied images from the api website to visual the cards drawn. Once the cards have been drawn I then let the user decide the actions and use the established rules of blackjack and the information provided by the API to determine the results.

I also added in a card counter. Card counting is a blackjack trick to help success at winning.

## Difficulties

At first getting data out into the global scope was trick. I was either getting unusable data or couldnt leave the local scope. Once I figured that out it was just implementing all the rules in blackjack.

After that the biggest difficulties was styling. CSS is easily my weakest part of front end. I kept changing how the style was every day, and will probably change it after this is written. But trying countless different styles and trying to get them to work has improved my css alot. I'm still not finished with how this looks but I'm not sure i'll ever be.
